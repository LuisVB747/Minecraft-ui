If you have any bonus specs, bonus or any details the TA's should know, you should include it here:

## Bonus: 
- Added an Armor State: State where you equip armor and defensive stats will be added to the player.

- Added a Boss State: State where you fight a Boss, which in this case was the Ender Dragon. You attack the boss and recieve damage from the boss. 

- Added a 3D World State: State where you can move and destroy blocks (had some issues putting blocks between and with other implementations, so for final product we took those out.)

- Added different items and changed/fixed some items from the original sprite.
